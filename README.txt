This project consists of a native android application for the front-end and utilizes Google App Engine/ NDB Datastore for the cloud back-end.

This application is designed to be used by patient transporters in the medical field. In large hospitals there is usually a transport department 
that is involved in transporting patients between all the different facilities in the hospital. A patient transporter will receive an assigned
transport request to take a patient from one place or another. It is important to be able to track patients, transporters, and transport requests
in large hospitals, which is what this app is intended for. Other hospital departments will also access this app to create or view current transport jobs.
